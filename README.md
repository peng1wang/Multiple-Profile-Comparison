# Multiple-Profile-Comparison

This repository is for work "Collaborative Monitoring of Wind Turbine Performance Degradation based on Probabilistic Power Curve Comparison" which is received a second review in Renewable Energy (IF: 8.63). In this paper, we compared the profile functions of numerous wind turbines in the same wind farm. The structure of this repository is as follows:

1. R folder contains necessary .R file for nonparameteric control chart based on boundary corrected kernel density estimation.
2. data folder contains partial data for this project.
3. profile_construction_DPC/QPC.ipynb: Density Power Curve and Quantile Power Curve are constructed in these two file.
4. profile monitoring.ipynb: Two kinds of monitoring algorithm are discussed in this file.
5. Relative plot.ipynb: Plotting code is integrated in this file.
6. Baseline.ipynb: Several baselines are introduced in this file.
